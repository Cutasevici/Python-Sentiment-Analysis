This is my first ever attempt at a sentiment analysis project. This project uses the NLTK library and a language model
from the TensorFlow library to perform some analysis on a small dataset of up to 200 comments that is then displayed
in a graph with the positive or negative indexing. The dataset is gathered in real-time using a video URL and Selenium.
